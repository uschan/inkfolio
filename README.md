> **"The Code is the Brush • The Paper is your Screen"**

**Wild Salt** is an experimental digital art gallery featuring 40 unique procedural landscapes created entirely with CSS and HTML. No SVG, Canvas, or WebGL was used for the artwork rendering. It explores the boundaries of CSS styling through intricate hatching techniques, gradients, and clip-paths to simulate hand-drawn ink sketches.

## 🎨 Features

- **Pure CSS Art**: All 40 sketches (Mountains, Forests, Abstracts) are rendered using DOM elements and CSS gradients.
- **Procedural Hatching**: Custom algorithms to simulate pen strokes, stippling, and cross-hatching.
- **Immersive UX**:
  - Custom ink-flow cursor.
  - Parallax scrolling with series-based storytelling.
  - "Reveal" animations using Intersection Observers.
  - 3D Tilt effects on artwork cards.
- **Responsive Design**: Full waterfall layout that adapts from mobile to ultra-wide displays.
- **Theme System**: High-contrast "Paper Mode" and "Midnight Mode" with smooth transitions.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Core**: React 19, TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS (Utility), Custom CSS (Art Rendering)
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Deployment**: Nginx, Linux (Ubuntu)
